# YOLOv8 Object Detection 🚀

This project demonstrates **basic object detection using YOLOv8** with a pre-trained model from the **Ultralytics** library.  
The model is used to detect objects either from a **static image** or using the **laptop webcam**.

This task was completed as part of the **µLearn Level 3 – AI Interest Group** activity.
